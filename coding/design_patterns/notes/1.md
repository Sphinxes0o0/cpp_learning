| Creational  | Abstract Factory       | Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| Creational  | Builder                | Constructs complex objects step by step, allowing different types and representations. |
| Creational  | Factory Method         | Defines an interface for creating objects, letting subclasses choose the type. |
| Creational  | Prototype              | Copies existing objects without depending on their classes. |
| Creational  | Singleton              | Ensures a class has only one instance with a global access point. |
| Structural  | Adapter                | Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. |
| Structural  | Bridge                 | Separates abstraction from implementation for independent development. |
| Structural  | Composite              | Composes objects into tree structures, treating them as individual objects. |
| Structural  | Decorator              | Adds behaviors to objects dynamically using wrapper objects. |
| Structural  | Facade                 | Provides a simplified interface to complex subsystems. |
| Structural  | Flyweight              | Shares common state to save memory for multiple objects. |
| Structural  | Proxy                  | Controls access to an object with a substitute or placeholder. |
| Behavioral  | Chain of Responsibility| Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one processes it. |
| Behavioral  | Command                | Encapsulates requests as objects for parameterization and queuing. |
| Behavioral  | Interpreter            | Defines a grammar and interpreter for a language to evaluate expressions. |
| Behavioral  | Iterator               | Traverses a collection’s elements without exposing its structure. |
| Behavioral  | Mediator               | Reduces object dependencies by forcing collaboration through a mediator. |
| Behavioral  | Memento                | Saves and restores an object’s state without exposing its details. |
| Behavioral  | Observer               | Notifies multiple objects of state changes via a subscription mechanism. |
| Behavioral  | State                  | Changes an object’s behavior based on its internal state. |
| Behavioral  | Strategy               | Defines interchangeable algorithms in separate classes. |
| Behavioral  | Template Method        | Defines an algorithm’s skeleton, letting subclasses customize steps. |
| Behavioral  | Visitor                | Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on. |
